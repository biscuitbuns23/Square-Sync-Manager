# SquarespaceCompanion v0.0.1 is officially released as of March 28th 2023!
Squarespace Companion is an inventory manager for your Squarespace website. It automates the product upload process to save you time.
Additional functionalities are in development.

SquarespaceCompanion uses Squarespace's API and requires the Commerce Advanced subscription.

Here is a list of dependencies needed to run Squarespace companion:
Python 3.11
openpyxl 3.0.7
pandas 1.5.3
requests 2.28.2

After downloading and installing dependecies, then cloning the repository, a small amount of initial setup is required.
Run the program and navigate to 'info' where you can see instructions on how to configure your column headers. Next,
navigate to settings to set column header configuration and your api key.

Once your initial setup is done you can use your existing inventory excel spreadsheet to create batches of products,
or you can create individual products.

NOTE: Excel is the only spreadsheet type supported in v0.0.1.
