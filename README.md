(Dear evaluators, please see the project resume [here](https://github.com/biscuitbuns23/Square-Sync-Manager/blob/Initial-consolidated/docs/Project%20Resume.md) before you leave.)

Square Sync Manager is an inventory manager for your Squarespace ecommerce website. It automates the product upload process to save you time.
Additional functionalities are in development.

Square Sync Manager (from here on referred to as SSM) uses Squarespace's API and requires the Commerce Advanced subscription.

NOTE: Excel is the only spreadsheet type supported in v0.0.1 through v0.0.3.1 (current version)

HOW IT WORKS:
Instead of creating products one at a time on your Squarespace website, SSM lets you import directly
from excel. This is especially useful if you use excel to track inventory.

After downloading and installing the most recent release, a small amount of initial setup is required.
SSM needs a few pieces of information about your excel sheet in order to work, this information is referred to as the column
headers. SSM adapts to your spreadsheet so you don't have to change the layout for SSM to work properly. Simply tell it the 
names of the columns used for product name, sku, item description, price, and quantity (a 'Deleted' column was added in v0.0.3. See update notes).
The column headers and the API key will need to be setup in the 'settings' menu before creating any products from your inventory sheet.

Once your initial setup is done you can use your existing inventory excel spreadsheet to create batches of products.
