In order for Squarespace Companion to interface with your inventory spreadsheet 
it needs to know the column headers that are used. For example; if your items are 
listed in rows, you probably have data such as "name", "description", and "price", 
set as the column headers. 

The column headers that are required to be configured are: 
name 
SKU 
item description 
price 
quantity
deleted

If your inventory spreadsheet does not have columns with this info then you must 
create them. This is the minimum info needed to create new products. 

How to set the configuration: 
Input the names of your column headers in the fields above and click save. You
must type them EXACTLY as they appear on the spreadsheet. This only needs to be
done once unless you change the headers on your excel file.
