Dear readers, thank you for taking the time to read more about my project.

This application is what started me down the path of coding. I had only read half of a Python
book when my wife told me how much of a pain it was to create each product manually on her
Squarespace website. A quick search revealed there was no easy way to batch upload products, but
there was an API. I told her I'd take what I learned from the first half of that Python book and
figure out the rest on the way.

I beleive that when it comes to coding, the practical skills learned from overcoming obstacles
that lie between you and your goal are far more valuable than the number of hours you spend
reading about coding in a classroom. Below are some of the skills demonstrated throughout
this projects codebase:

- Encryption and Decryption of sensitive data
- Password hashing and secure storage
- CRUD operations using pickle
- Custom built light-weight secure user authentication system
- Model View Controller (MVC) software architecture
- eCommerce API implementation
- Tkinter user interface using CustomTkinter
- Code documentation
- Software use documentation
- PEP 257 & PEP 8
- Python language
- Agile methodologies (yes, I practiced by myself) using Jira
