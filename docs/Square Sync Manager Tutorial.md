1. If you don't have a Squarespace website set up, follow my Squarespace account setup tutorial [here](https://github.com/biscuitbuns23/Square-Sync-Manager/blob/Initial-consolidated/docs/Squarespace%20account%20tutorial.md) (It's in the docs folder).
   
2. Follow the instructions for downloading and installing the latest release [here](https://github.com/biscuitbuns23/Square-Sync-Manager/releases).
   
3. Open Square Sync Manager, create your account, and proceed to the settings page.
The entry fields on the settings page each correspond to a column header on your inventory
file. In order to upload the items to your website SSM needs to know exactly what these column
headers are called so it can assemble the product information correctly. Fill in all the entry
fields using the image below as a reference.

4. Next you need to enter your API key in the corresponding field. The Squarespace account setup
instructions in step 1 will tell you where to find the API key.

5. Last, you'll need to select your inventory file. If you don't have one yet you can use
the inventory template included under the "docs" folder.
